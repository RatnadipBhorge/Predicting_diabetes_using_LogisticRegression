# Predicting_diabetes_using_LogisticRegression
Applying Logistic Regression algorithm and Obtained accuracy 79% 
By observation we found that on diabetes data we can apply the Logistic Regression
To increase the accuracy the data is incomplete as parameter like glucose, skin thickness, Blood pressure values are zero in most of the rows and these parameters cant be zero.
If we are replacing zero with mean or mode it will not be considerable.
